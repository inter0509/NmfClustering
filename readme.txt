This directory includes all the code files for the document clustering example:
	bestMap.m + hungarian.m: hungarian matching set algorithm implementation
	kmeans.m: the K-means clustering implementation
	MutualInfo.m: the normalized mutual information computation
	NMF.m: the non-negative matrix factorization implementation
	NormalizeFea.m: feature normalization
	run.m: the running example

The NMF.m file, kmeans.m and run.m file are implemented by Ziyi Guo(zig312@lehigh.edu)
Data clustering files, bestMap.m, hungarian.m, MutualInfo.m and NormalizeFea.m are downloaded by Prof. Deng Cai's homepage: http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/dengcai/

Just type "run" in matlab commend line to run a data clustering example
